## Technical Front-End Developer Questions

### HTML Front-End Developer Questions

32. **_What are the differences between HTML5 and HTML4?_**

HTML5 introduced new elements like `<article>`, `<section>`, `<video>`, and better multimedia handling, while removing elements like `<font>` and providing better support for responsive design.

/_ Styles for tablets and mobile _/
}

```

### JavaScript Front-End Developer Questions

35. What is the difference between `==` and `===`?

`==` performs type coercion before comparing, while `===` checks both value and type, making it a stricter comparison.

36. **_What is the difference between an anonymous function and a named function?_**

### CSS Front-End Developer Questions

38. **_What are the differences between inline, embedded, and external stylesheets?_**

Inline styles are applied directly in the HTML tag, embedded styles are within the

`<style>` tag in the HTML file, and external stylesheets are linked to an HTML file
via the `<link>` tag.

39. **_How do you create a responsive layout?_**

By using media queries, flexible units like `em` or `%`, and responsive frameworks like Bootstrap or CSS Grid/Flexbox.

40. **_How do you use animation and transitions?_**

CSS animations and transitions allow smooth changes in element properties over time. For example:

```css
.box {
  transition: transform 0.3s ease;
}
.box:hover {
  transform: scale(1.2);
}
```

### HTML Questions

1. **_What is HTML?_**

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It describes the structure of a webpage using elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, and images.

2. **_What is a DOCTYPE in HTML?_**

A DOCTYPE is a declaration that tells the web browser which version of HTML the page is written in. It ensures that the browser renders the page correctly.

3. **_What is the difference between `<div>` and `<span>` in HTML?_**

`<div>` is a block-level element, meaning it takes up the full width available. It is used for grouping content. `<span>` is an inline element, meaning it takes only the space its content needs, and is used to apply styles to parts of text.

4. **_What is the purpose of the alt attribute on an `<img>` tag?_**

The alt attribute provides alternative text for an image if it cannot be displayed. It also improves accessibility for visually impaired users and helps with SEO.

5. **_What is semantic HTML?_**

Semantic HTML refers to using HTML elements for their intended purposes. For example, using `<article>`, `<section>`, `<header>`, and `<footer>` to clearly define the structure of the content, improving accessibility and SEO.

6. **_What is the difference between localStorage and sessionStorage in HTML5?_**

localStorage stores data with no expiration time, meaning the data persists even after the browser is closed. sessionStorage stores data for a session, and the data is cleared when the page session ends (when the browser is closed).

7. **_What are the new form input types introduced in HTML5?_**

HTML5 introduced new input types like _email, url, tel, date, time, range, color_, and _search._

8. **_What is the difference between a class and an id in HTML?_**

An id is unique within the page and is used to identify one specific element, while a class can be used on multiple elements and is generally used for styling groups of elements.

9. **_What are meta tags in HTML?_**

Meta tags provide metadata about the HTML document, such as descriptions, keywords, viewport settings, and character sets. These tags are placed in the
`<head>` section.

10. **_How can you make a hyperlink open in a new tab?_**

By adding the `target="\_blank"` attribute to an `<a>` tag, the link will open in a new tab.

11. **_What is the aria-label attribute used for?_**

The aria-label provides an accessible name for an element, often used with screen readers for users with disabilities.

12. **_What is the difference between the b tag and strong tag in HTML?_**

Both render text as bold, but strong has semantic meaning, indicating importance, while b is purely presentational.

13. **_What is the difference between the `<canvas>` element and the `<svg>` element?_**

`<canvas>` is pixel-based and used for drawing graphics on the fly, while `<svg>` is vector-based and scales better for various screen sizes.

14. **_How does the `<picture>` tag improve responsive image handling?_**

The `<picture>` element allows you to specify different images for different screen sizes or resolutions, optimizing performance.

15. **_What is the role of the `<template>` tag in HTML5?_**

`<template>` is used to declare fragments of HTML that are not rendered when the page loads but can be later activated using JavaScript.

16. **_What is the defer attribute in the `<script>` tag used for?_**

It tells the browser to execute the script after the document has been parsed, improving page load performance.

17. **_What is an HTML entity, and why is it important?_**

HTML entities represent reserved characters `(like < as &lt;)`. They're necessary to display characters that would otherwise be interpreted as HTML.

18. **_What does the `<link rel="stylesheet">` tag do in HTML?_**

It links an external CSS file to an HTML document, allowing the document to use styles defined in the file.

19. **_How do you make a dropdown list using HTML?_**

Use the `<select>` element with `<option>` tags inside. Example:

```css
<select>
  <option>Option 1</option>
</select>
```

20. **_What is the purpose of the `<details>` and `<summary>` tags in HTML5?_**

These elements allow for a collapsible content section that can be opened or closed by the user.

21. **_How can you include audio and video in a web page using HTML5?_**

Use the `<audio>` and `<video>` elements with appropriate src attributes.

Example:

```css
<video controls>
  <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

```

22. **_How do you make text editable in HTML?_**

Use the contenteditable attribute on an element, like `<div contenteditable="true">Editable text</div>`.

23. **_What is the use of the `<noscript>` tag in HTML?_**

The `<noscript>` tag defines alternative content to be displayed if JavaScript is disabled or unsupported in the browser.

24. **_What is the difference between HTML `<script>` tags placed in `<head>` versus at the end of the `<body>`?_**

Scripts in the `<head>` block rendering until they load, while scripts placed before `</body`> allow the HTML content to load first, improving perceived performance.

25. **_What is the role of the action attribute in a form tag?_**

The action attribute specifies where to send the form data when the form is submitted.

26. **_What is the placeholder attribute in HTML?_**

It provides a hint to the user of what they should enter into an input field, visible before the user types.

27. **_How does HTML5 improve form validation?_**

HTML5 introduces built-in validation features, such as required, pattern, email, and number input types, without relying on JavaScript.

28. **_What is the purpose of the `<meta>` tag?_**

The `<meta>` tag provides metadata about the HTML document, such as character set, page description, keywords, author, and viewport settings

29. **_What is the `<canvas>` element used for?_**

The `<canvas>` element is used to draw graphics on the fly via JavaScript, allowing for dynamic, scriptable rendering of 2D shapes and images.

30. **_What is the difference between block-level and inline elements?_**

Block-level elements occupy the full width available and start on a new line (e.g., `<div>`, `<h1>`), while inline elements only take up as much width as necessary and do not start on a new line (e.g., `<span>`, `<a>`).

31. **_What is the purpose of the `<form>` element?_**

The `<form>` element is used to collect user input, containing various input elements like text fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, and submit buttons.

32. **_What is the difference between the `<link>` and `<script>` tags?_**

The `<link>` tag is used to link external resources like CSS stylesheets, while the `<script>` tag is used to include or reference JavaScript files.
