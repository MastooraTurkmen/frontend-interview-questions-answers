# Frontend Interview Questions and Answers

### Basic Front-End Engineer Interview Questions

1. **_What is a CDN?_**

A CDN (Content Delivery Network) is a distributed network of servers that deliver web content to users based on their geographic location. It improves site performance by caching static assets like images, CSS, and JavaScript closer to the user's location.

2. **_What is AJAX?_**

AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) allows web pages to communicate with a server asynchronously, without reloading the page. It is commonly used for dynamic content loading.

3. **_What are the differences between HTML and XHTML?_**

XHTML is a stricter, XML-based version of HTML. Differences include the requirement of well-formed documents, lowercase tags, properly closed tags, and attributes that must be quoted.

4. **_What is responsive design?_**

Responsive design ensures that a website's layout adapts to different screen sizes and devices, providing an optimal user experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

5. **_What are the different types of CSS selectors?_**

   - CSS selectors include:
   - Element selectors (e.g., div)
   - Class selectors (e.g., .class-name)
   - ID selectors (e.g., #id-name)
   - Attribute selectors (e.g., input[type="text"])
   - Pseudo-class selectors (e.g., :hover)

6. **_What is a pseudo-class?_**

A pseudo-class is used to define the special state of an element, such as :hover, :focus, or :nth-child.

7. **_What is a CSS reset?_**

A CSS reset removes default browser styling, ensuring consistent styling across different browsers by resetting elements like margins, padding, and font sizes.

8. **_What is a CSS grid system?_**

A CSS grid system is a layout system based on rows and columns, enabling developers to create complex, responsive layouts with ease. Modern CSS Grid or Flexbox are popular systems.

9. **_What is a CSS preprocessor?_**

A CSS preprocessor extends CSS functionality by allowing variables, nested rules, and mixins. Examples include Sass, LESS, and Stylus.

10. **_What are the benefits of using a CSS preprocessor?_**

- Benefits include:
  - Variables for consistent styling
  - Reusability through mixins and functions
  - Cleaner code structure with nesting
  - Better maintainability and scalability

11. **_What is Bootstrap?_**

Bootstrap is a popular front-end framework that provides pre-built components, grid systems, and responsive design utilities for faster web development.

12. **_What are the benefits of using Bootstrap?_**
    • Benefits include:
    • Pre-designed responsive components
    • Cross-browser compatibility
    • Fast development with reusable components
    • A wide community and strong documentation

13. **_What is a task runner?_**

A task runner, like Gulp or Grunt, automates repetitive development tasks such as minifying files, compiling CSS preprocessors, or live reloading during development.

14. **_What are the benefits of using a task runner?_**

Task runners increase productivity by automating tasks, improving build efficiency, ensuring code consistency, and reducing human error.

15. **_What made you become a front-end developer?_**

Personalize your answer based on your journey and passion for development, creativity, or problem-solving.

16. **_What is your favorite thing about being a front-end developer?_**

Share personal insights, such as the ability to bring designs to life, constant learning, or interaction with cutting-edge technologies.
